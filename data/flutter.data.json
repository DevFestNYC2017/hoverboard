Even if you have built a performant app with a great UI, you can improve it by leveraging new methods of adding machine learning to your apps to create a really useful and enticing mobile app experience. In this talk, youâ€™ll learn some basics of machine learning and how to integrate it into your mobile app, first with some clever APIs, and then with custom trained models using TensorFlow.

We migrated from a monolithic app module to multi-module project structure and reduced the size of our app significantly. During the talk we will walk through the process how to build Instant Apps step by step.
