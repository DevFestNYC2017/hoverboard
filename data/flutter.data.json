In this talk, you’ll learn some basics of machine learning and how to integrate it into your mobile app, first with some clever APIs, and then with custom trained models using TensorFlow.

We migrated from a monolithic app module to multi-module project structure and reduced the size of our app significantly. During the talk we will walk through the process how to build Instant Apps step by step. The talk will also cover Instant Apps types, architecture changes, project structure, size and feature constraints, practical tips to slim down the application, lessons learnt, issues we ran into and benefits gained.",
