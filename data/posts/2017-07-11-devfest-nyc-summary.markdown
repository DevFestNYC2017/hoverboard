[DevFest NYC 2016](https://devfestnyc.com/) was the inaugural 2-day developer conference organized by the [Google Developer Group (NYC)](https://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc). It was our first foray into the conference organization space and while we learnt a lot from the process, we are also extremely proud of pulling off a successful event.


On behalf of the DFNYCâ€™s Team we warmly thank you for helping make [GDG DevFest NYC 2016](https://devfestnyc.com/) a huge success. 

The event took place on 19-20th of November at the [The Flatrion School NYC](https://flatironschool.com/) with a second dedicated (Go Language Training) event happening concurrently at General Assembly NYC as a fifth (bonus) track.

The main event had three tracks: a main tech-talks track, a secondary workshops track, a 2-day hackathon track -- and a bonus "self-guided on-demand" codelabs track where participants could simply plug in and work on one of 50+ codelabs available for independent learning.

We are very grateful to the numerous sponsors who helped make that event a success. In 2017, we are focusing on a single venue with 3 tracks: tech-talks (Day 1) and workshops + hackathon (Day 2). The intent this time is simpler. We want to create awareness of key technologies on Day 1, with the opportunity for attendees to attend immersive learning workshops on a subset of these, on Day 2. Hope to see you there!
